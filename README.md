## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on conflict-inflation models for open and peripheral economies.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on macroeconomic analysis and data-driven projects.
- 🤔 I’m currently looking for roles in macroeconomic research / analysis.
- 💬 Ask me about jazz in Mexico City — I wrote a thesis on it: https://repositorio.colmex.mx/concern/theses/mp48sg20v?locale=es

⚡ Fun fact: I did a master’s in Urban Studies, where I wrote a thesis on the Mexican jazz scene in Mexico City, and later shifted toward macro/finance research.
